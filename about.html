		<p class="d-flex justify-content-start">I’m an Industrial Engineer from Serbia. My native language is Serbian and I’m fluent in English.  Working as a Curator Content Coordinator for DI.FM (Digitally Imported) company gave me an amazing job experience, working in teams with people all over the globe and learning so many valuable skills that I use and apply every day on the work. The company received few major awards (2010 International Dance Music Awards (IDMA) – Best Global Radio Station and 2014 RAIN Awards – Best Overall Online Radio Service) and working for them is something that I’m really proud and their choice to hire me speaks for itself. In FamouSocial I was in charge of creating Facebook ADs for FORD Car Dealership in Canada in 3 separate locations and also creating Facebook ADs and Click Funnels for their other clients where I learned about Social Media Marketing and SEO. Working as a Virtual Assistant for Joel Burroughs b2bleadgenexpert agency where I learned Lead Generation and Email Scraping using Linkedin and Linkedin Sales Navigator and managed Email Marketing campaigns using Agile CRM. I also worked for Linkpitch agency on Link Building and Outreach using Pitchbox.  As a freelancer managed Instagram, Facebook and LinkedIn accounts (liking, commenting, finding new contacts etc.). Working as a Transcriber for 84Factory where I transcribed calls for car dealerships in USA. As Data Researcher I worked for LeadGenius company where I learned valuable skills like Lead Generation, Email Scraping and Validation, Lead Enrichment and Data Entry which led me to many job opportunities and projects. Working for WASTAC company on Image Annotation jobs I have perfected my senses of observation and precision which made me a better choice for quality work and has given me an advantage over the rest.  My typing speed is around 60 to 70 words per minute. My hobbies are: sports, music and movies.
